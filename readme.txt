== Description ==

Having tested this using Firefox, Edge, Chrome on Windows 10 & Linux it works on all except for Chrome on Windows 10!
You can bypass this in Chrome by searching in the developer tools, locate the cookies, go to Tinychat.com, locate a cookie named "remember_random-number", and change the value for 'Same Site' to none and remove the tick for HttpOnly and add a tick in 'Secure',
This may only be affecting some users.

You now have to register to use the chat, you can do that at <a href="https://tinychat.com" rel="nofollow ugc" >Tinychat</a> , I apologise about that.
